# 100 in 100
I have always kind of had an ax to grind against React. Putting the HTML in with the code reminded me of PHP in a bad way. 
Javascript codewords aren't available in JSX, creating clunkys workarounds like `className`. But it is here to stay, so I am going to learn it. 
I have used it in a couple projects, but stayed away when I could choose the tech stack myself at work or at home. 

100 in 100 will be me trying to immersive myself in React, creating 100 small projects in 100 days. Hopefully I will be able to keep up with one per day (it is day 2 already!) but if I can't, catching up on the weekends WILL be allowed.

## Check In
It feels like I am quickly running out of ideas. It is tough to keep it going during the week, and I really wish I could dive more into each project, but want to hit my goal of 100 pens in 100 days. I am considering picking the top 20 or so and spending a week improving them at the end to polish them. This helps me not get caught up on how much more I want to do, since I can pretend I will return to it later. :)

At first I did not think I would like functional components because they make the component into a procederal bit of spaghetti code, but the Hooks do make it worth it. If it gets to long and noodley, that is just a smell to turn it into multiple components anyway. I do like the hooks- though maybe just by comparison of trying to use context in a class component. :) 

## Day 21: Allergy Shot Reaction Diary, an app only for me
https://codepen.io/mackenziewall/pen/jOYyzvQ

I am thinking the 100 will not be consecutive, guys. Not only am I starting to run out of ideas small enough for a single day, but I REALLY want to go back and iterate on ones I have already done, for example adding validation for chess and an AI for all the games. Still going to strive for 100 projects, but timeline may be shifting. I would say I have actually already accomplished my goal- getting comfortable with react! I still want to hit 100, but I don't think I am going to keep rushing- might make it a calendar year goal instead. I think it is important to not throw away work just because it didn't turn out how you expected, so that's what I'll do. :)
