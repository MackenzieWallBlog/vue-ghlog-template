# 100 in 100
I have always kind of had an ax to grind against React. Putting the HTML in with the code reminded me of PHP in a bad way. 
Javascript codewords aren't available in JSX, creating clunkys workarounds like `className`. But it is here to stay, so I am going to learn it. 
I have used it in a couple projects, but stayed away when I could choose the tech stack myself at work or at home. 

100 in 100 will be me trying to immersive myself in React, creating 100 small projects in 100 days. Hopefully I will be able to keep up with one per day (it is day 2 already!) but if I can't, catching up on the weekends WILL be allowed.

## Check In
It feels like I am quickly running out of ideas. It is tough to keep it going during the week, and I really wish I could dive more into each project, but want to hit my goal of 100 pens in 100 days. I am considering picking the top 20 or so and spending a week improving them at the end to polish them. This helps me not get caught up on how much more I want to do, since I can pretend I will return to it later. :)

## Day 16: Go
